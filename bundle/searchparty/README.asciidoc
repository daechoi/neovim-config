_Extended search commands and maps for Vim_

Visual Searches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +*+  Searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindNext+

* +#+  Searches for the prior occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindPrior+

* +&+  Starts a +:substitute+ using the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindSubstitute+

LiterSearch~

* +g/+ Prompts for a literal string to search for. This does NOT use a regular
       expression, so the characters you type here will be searched for
       literally without any magic interpretation. The +<Up>+ key scrolls
       through prior literal search history.
